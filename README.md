# Identity Recognition App
Android app for identity recognition.

## Introduction
This is a proof-of-concept (POC) for identity recognition on an Android device I built in my previous internship.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and build and run with Android Studio on a physical Android device. Do not use an emulator since it requires a camera. Instructions to set up the identity recognition server on AWS will be added on a later date
